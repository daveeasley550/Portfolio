            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
              I am a newly minted, goal oriented, Full Stack Engineer with a
              passion for continuing to learn. I love working on a team and
              contributing to achieve a goal. My communication and interpersonal
              skills are excellent, coupled with my adaptability and leadership
              skills, allow for seamless transitions within developer teams and
              environments.

            I recently retired from the Army after 20 years of service. While I
            was a Soldier, my main duties were as a Flight Instructor and
            mechanic on the UH-60 helicopter. I was a project lead for numerous
            major maintenance projects as well as creating doctrine and training
            methods for the units in which I was currently assigned. Problem
            solving and conflict resolution are some of my strong points. I
            think that is why I enjoy coding, attention to detail while managing
            time, coupled with different approaches to attain a common goal. I
            like to get things done.

            During my time in the Military, I was afforded several training
            opportunities as well as difficult assignments. I thrive in high
            stress environments and really enjoy accomplishing the goals set for
            myself and my team. Doing so while never losing sight of interests
            of the people on my team.

            My family and I have traveled and lived in several countries
            throughout Europe and the Middle East. Traveling is something that
            we love to do. While on our adventures, we like to really immerse
            ourselves in the local cultures and experience life as close to
            being a local as possible while still seeing all the sights. We feel
            that it is important to do so for our children to experience life
            outside of America. Diversity, charity, respect, and empathy are
            learned through experience and immersing my children in other
            cultures, has thus far, helped in molding them into outstanding
            future members of society.
